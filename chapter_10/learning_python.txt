In Python, you can do all kinds of crazy shit! It is fully a object oriented language. It, of course, has classes, multiple inheritance, but I don't think it has mehtod overloading. Nonetheless, Python is full of higher level language functionality. It forms executable blocks of code based on indention thus, neatly formatted code is a by-product of this structure. No braces or brackets enclose blocks of code. No, when the indention stops, the block ends. Also, I just discovered that there is no variable scoping as in created in and scoped to a block. You can declare and assign the variable inside a block and use it outside the block.
